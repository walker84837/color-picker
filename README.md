# Color picker

Just the code from [the original](https://gist.github.com/walker84837/66eb37d72d1bc3c98221cf4e1b83f724) one I made, but rewritten in Rust using [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com), with some changes to the CSS.

### Run this project

Run the following command in the root of the repo to start developing for the web:

```bash

```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```

## Contributing

I like to admit I'm not a very good web developer by any chance, so if you see something that doesn't look right, please make an issue or a PR!
